netzsim runs a **continuous time-series power flow** on a distribution grid with
[pandapower](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower) and turns it into an
interactive teaching tool for grid operation, observability and control. It
loads a grid plus daily 1-minute profiles, advances one 1-minute step per
*accelerated tick* of wall-clock time (a full day in ≈ 24 min at the default
rate), and streams every solved step live. After step 1439 it wraps to step 0,
increments a day counter and repeats indefinitely.

The pedagogical core is the **three-layer view of a grid**:

1. **Reality** — the true power flow, computed at every bus and line each step.
2. **What you can measure** — only quantities where a smart meter or transformer
   meter is placed; everything else is unknown. Real low-voltage grids are
   almost unobservable, and the UI shows that.
3. **What you can estimate** — a WLS state estimation reconstructs the whole grid
   from the sparse meter readings plus the grid model and load assumptions. How
   close it gets to reality is exactly the lesson.

On top of that sits a **runtime toolkit** — place batteries, PV, EV wallboxes,
overload controllers and regulated transformers live — and a full **vertical
MV/LV integration**: medium-voltage districts with dozens of low-voltage cells,
hierarchical estimation, and a grid-traffic-light (Netzampel) control cascade.

A German **Benutzerhandbuch** (`docs/Benutzerhandbuch.pdf`) is the complete
user guide. Developer documentation: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
(system architecture) and [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) (generated REST
reference; interactive Swagger UI at `/docs`); `CLAUDE.md` is the exhaustive
development log.

## The three applications

One `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the whole stack:

| App | What it is | Port |
|-----|-----------|------|
| **netzsim** (`src/`) | the FastAPI power-flow service (REST + WebSocket) | 8000 |
| **UI** (`ui/`) | a React + Vite + Leaflet frontend (German default, DE/EN) | 8080 (nginx) / 5173 (dev) |
| **Visualization** (`visualization/`) | a collector → InfluxDB → Grafana dashboard | 8086 / 3000 |

---

## What it can do

- **Grid catalog & districts.** Pick from committed synthetic German grids on
  real geography (from the sibling [`gridgen`](../gridgen) project) — rural /
  suburban low-voltage feeders and whole medium-voltage districts — or import a
  JSON drawn in [`gridedit`](../gridedit). The **Netz & Lasten** view assigns
  realistic household load profiles (LPG library, optional multi-family
  buildings, EV and PV penetration) and previews the transformer loading before
  you start.
- **Three parallel views** of every step — **Lastfluss** (truth), **Gemessen**
  (metered only), **Schätzung** (WLS estimate) — each with its own data layer
  and a real Leaflet/OSM map that colours by loading and voltage.
- **Observability by meter placement.** Click a node or transformer to place a
  smart / transformer meter; per-device TAF fidelity (TAF 9/10/14 minute-level
  telemetry vs. TAF 7 15-minute Lastgang). Strict mode
  (`NETZSIM_EXPOSE_GROUND_TRUTH=false`) makes the server withhold the truth
  entirely.
- **WLS state estimation** (`estimator.py`) from the placed meters, the grid
  model, structural zero-injection knowledge and profile pseudo-measurements —
  configurable policy (PV/EV pseudo, SLP vs. profile basis, std, hierarchy).
- **Runtime equipment**, added/edited/removed live: batteries (self-consumption
  / peak-shaving / price strategies), rooftop PV, EV charge windows, and
  **§14a-style overload controllers** that dim EV charging or curtail PV feed-in
  — fed *only* from the operator's view (meters + estimate), so control quality
  equals observability.
- **Vertical MV/LV integration.** A district is a set of **Ortsnetz-Zellen**
  (secondary-substation cells). Estimation runs **hierarchically** (each cell
  estimates locally, its boundary flow feeds the MV-level estimate); a
  **Netzampel cascade** lets an MV coordinator signal every cell's controller to
  throttle proportionally; a **regelbarer Ortsnetztrafo (rONT)** holds a cell's
  busbar voltage in a deadband. A side-panel cell table with map drill-down
  shows all cells at once.
- **Scenarios** (`data/scenarios/*.json`) — hand-editable *recipes* (grid +
  loadgen + runtime DER ops + meters + clock). Four reference scenarios ship,
  including *#4 "Feierabend im Bezirk"*, the vertical teaching path where a
  medium-voltage congestion is invisible to every individual cell.
- **Data export** — record a live session or bulk-replay whole days offline into
  tidy CSV packs (`data/recordings/`) for analysis in Python / MATLAB / Excel.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python ≥ 3.10 and Node.js ≥ 18 (≥ 20 if you want to run the UI
tests) — or just Docker, which needs neither. On Linux `install.sh` brings both
along itself. The grid dataset (ding0 MV districts, street-routed LV grids, the
LPG load library) is committed under `data/`, so nothing else has to be fetched.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markisbell/rtpowerflow.git
cd rtpowerflow
```

### Linux — one command

```bash
./install.sh                 # equivalently: bash install.sh
```

This sets up a fresh machine end to end: system packages through the
distribution's package manager (apt · dnf · pacman · zypper), the Python
dependencies into a project-local `.venv`, **Node.js** (from the distribution
when it ships ≥ 20, otherwise the official SHA256-verified nodejs.org tarball
into `.tools/` — that path needs no root at all), and the UI's npm packages.
It finishes with a smoke test that boots the backend and asks `/health`.
Re-running updates only what is missing.

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `--dev` | also install pytest/httpx, so `pytest` runs |
| `--no-root` | never use sudo — nothing is installed system-wide |
| `--python python3.12` | pin the interpreter used for the venv |
| `--node-version v22.20.0` | pin the locally installed Node version |
| `--build-tools` | add compilers (only needed if a wheel must be built from source) |
| `--skip-ui` · `--recreate` · `--no-verify` | backend only · rebuild from scratch · skip the smoke test |

### Windows

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`start_netzsim.bat` then runs `npm install` for the UI by itself on first start.

### Docker — needs neither Python nor Node

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Brings up the whole stack at once: UI :8080 · netzsim :8000 · InfluxDB :8086 ·
Grafana :3000.

## Run it

### Windows: double-click launcher (recommended here)

`start_netzsim.bat` starts the backend (default :8000) and the Vite UI (default
:5173) in their own console windows, runs `npm install` if needed, guards
against double-starts, and opens the browser. To stop, run `stop_netzsim.bat`
(port-independent: finds this project's servers by window title and command
line, leaves a parallel stack alone) or close the two server windows. (The
sibling [`gridedit`](../gridedit) has `start_gridedit.bat` the same way.)

Ports are **not hard-wired**: if a default port is taken by a *foreign* app
(anything whose `/health` doesn't answer `"app": "netzsim"` — e.g. a parallel
[rtheatflow](https://github.com/markisbell/rtheatflow) stack), the launcher
automatically moves to the next free port and wires the UI proxy to match. Pin
ports explicitly with `NETZSIM_PORT` / `NETZSIM_UI_PORT` (environment or
`.env`); an already-running netzsim is recognized and reused.

### Linux: launcher scripts

```bash
./start_netzsim.sh     # backend + UI in the background, logs and PIDs in .run/
./stop_netzsim.sh      # ends only THIS project's servers
```

(Set up once with [`./install.sh`](#linux--one-command).) `start_netzsim.sh`
picks free ports exactly like the Windows launcher — a *foreign* app on :8000
pushes the backend to :8001 and the UI proxy follows; a running netzsim is
recognized via `/health` and reused. `stop_netzsim.sh` matches by working
directory rather than by port, so a parallel stack stays untouched. Options:
`--no-browser`, `--backend-only`.

> **Behind an HTTP proxy** (`http_proxy` set, e.g. on a campus network) the
> scripts bypass the proxy for localhost. Without that, the proxy answers the
> `/health` identity checks instead of the backend and the launcher never finds
> its own server.

### Local (Python ≥ 3.10)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py              # writes ./data/*.json (5-bus sample)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m netzsim.main               # http://localhost:8000/
```

The full committed dataset (ding0 MV districts, street-routed LV grids, the LPG
library) lives under `data/` — no external archive needed.

**The React UI** (dev):
```bash
cd ui && npm install && npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5173
```
> The dev proxy targets `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (not `localhost`): on Windows
> `localhost` resolves to IPv6 `::1` first, which uvicorn (IPv4-only) refuses.
> Running the backend elsewhere? `NETZSIM_PORT=8010 npm run dev` moves the
> proxy target, `NETZSIM_UI_PORT=5180` the dev server itself.

### Docker (full stack)

```bash
docker compose up --build
# ui :8080 · netzsim :8000 · influxdb :8086 (admin/netzsim-admin) · grafana :3000 (admin/admin)
```

Host-side ports are overridable via `.env` (`NETZSIM_HOST_PORT`, `UI_HOST_PORT`,
`INFLUX_HOST_PORT`, `GRAFANA_HOST_PORT`) so a second stack with the same
defaults can run in parallel; the container-internal wiring never changes.

See [`visualization/README.md`](visualization/README.md) for the Grafana stack.

```

Key design choices: **build once, step cheaply** (topology built a single time;
each step overwrites injection columns and calls `runpp`, optionally
warm-started); the power flow runs **off the event loop** (`asyncio.to_thread`)
so the API stays responsive; **profiles double as element definitions** (every
row in the load/generation/substation files becomes one pandapower element).

The system architecture (modules, data layers, vertical integration, design
rationale) is documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md);
the complete endpoint reference in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).

## Input file formats (native to pandapower)

All bus references are **integer indices matching the order of
`grid_structure.buses`** — exactly how pandapower assigns bus indices.

- **`grid_structure.json`** — `{name, f_hz, buses[{name, vn_kv, type, zone, in_service}]}`
- **`lines.json`** — `{lines[], transformers[]}`; each line uses a pandapower
  `std_type` *or* explicit `r/x/c_per_km` + `max_i_ka`.
- **`load.json` / `generation.json` / `substation.json`** — 1440 values per
  element: loads → `load` (`p_mw`/`q_mvar`), generation → `sgen`, substations →
  `ext_grid` slack set-points (`vm_pu`/`va_degree`).

`scripts/generate_sample_data.py` writes a 5-bus example set; real grids come
from the [`gridgen`](../gridgen) dataset committed under `data/`.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # or: pip install pytest httpx
pytest                    # backend suite
cd ui && npm run build    # type-check + build the frontend
```

## Validation

netzsim's physics is **benchmarked against OpenDSS (EPRI) and real MATPOWER
8.1** — full report with error tables, daily profile overlays and exact
engine versions in [`docs/benchmarks/`](docs/benchmarks/README.md), method
and reproduction steps in [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
Headline numbers: on byte-identical IEEE cases (14/30/118-bus) pandapower
and MATPOWER agree to **≤ 2.6e-10 pu**; the committed teaching grids
(30–475 buses) simulated over full 1440-step days agree with OpenDSS and
MATPOWER to **≈ 5e-7 pu (0.2 mV)** per step. Inputs are frozen fixtures
(`benchmarks/fixtures/`), regenerate everything with
`python benchmarks/run_all.py`.
